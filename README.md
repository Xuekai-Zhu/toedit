### ToEdit
This repository hosts the official implementation of the methods introduced in our paper “How to Synthesize Text Data without Model Collapse?” (ICML 2025). 
At the moment, the codebase is in its raw form—meaning it reflects the original research prototype and may not follow strict software engineering best practices.

Note: The repository is currently undergoing reorganization. We are actively working to improve the code structure, add documentation, and make it more user-friendly for the community.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to explore the raw code in the meantime!
